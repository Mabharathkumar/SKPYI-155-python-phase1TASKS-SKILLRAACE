TASKS A1:
i)Please write a program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["I", "You"]
 and verb is in ["Play", "Love"] and the object is in ["Cricket","Ludo"].
 
Project Explanation:
The project demonstrates a simple example of combinatorial generation using nested loops.
By iterating through all possible combinations of elements from different lists, 
it generates every possible sentence from the given sets of subjects, verbs,
and objects. This technique can be extended to more complex scenarios, such 
as generating variations of sentences for natural language processing, creating
test cases in software development, or forming different combinations of inputs 
for various applications.


TASK A1.1:
ii) Convert emoji into text in Python - Converting emoticons or emojis into text
 in Python can be done using thedemoji module. It is used to accurately remove
 and replace emojis in text strings

 Project Explanation
This project demonstrates how to process text containing emojis by converting 
those emojis into their descriptive names. This can be useful for various 
applications, 
such as:
Data Processing and Analysis: 
Converting emojis into text descriptions for easier text analysis and processing.
Accessibility: 
Making text more accessible by providing descriptions of emojis, which can be read
by screen readers.
Text Normalization: 
Standardizing text for applications where emojis might not be supported or desired, such as older systems or text-only platforms.
The demoji library simplifies handling emojis in Python by providing easy-to-use functions for downloading emoji codes and replacing emojis with their descriptions.
TASK B1:
 i)Design a ‘book’ class with title, author, publisher, price and author’s royalty as
 instance variables. Provide getter and setter properties for all variables. Also
 define a method royalty() to calculate royalty amount author can expect to
 receive the following royalties:10% of the retail price on the first 500 copies; 12.5%
 for the next 1,000 copies sold, then 15% for all further copies sold. Then design a
 new ‘ebook’ class inherited from ‘book’ class. Add ebook format (EPUB,
 PDF,MOBI etc) as additional instance variable in inherited class. Override
 royalty() method to deduct GST @12% on ebooks

Project Explanation
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, such as inheritance,
encapsulation, and polymorphism, in Python:
Inheritance: 
The Ebook class inherits from the Book class, reusing and extending its functionality.
Encapsulation: 
Attributes are made private (prefixed with an underscore) and accessed via getters and
setters to protect data integrity.
Polymorphism: 
The royalty method is overridden in the Ebook class to provide specialized behavior
for calculating ebook royalties, including GST.
This structure allows for clear and modular code that can be easily extended to handle more types of books or different royalty calculation rules.


TASK 1B.1:
 ii) Implement simple FLAMES game using Python.
 
 Project Explanation
This project demonstrates basic string manipulation, list operations, and iterative
algorithms in Python:
String Manipulation: 
Converts names to lowercase and removes spaces to standardize the input.
List Operations: 
Converts names to lists of characters, removes common characters, and iteratively 
manipulates the "FLAMES" list.
Algorithm Implementation: 
Implements the FLAMES game logic to predict the relationship based on character counts.
The project is a fun and engaging way to practice programming concepts while creating
a simple game that users can interact with.
